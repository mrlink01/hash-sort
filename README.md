# hash-sort
This program attempts to implement a recursive in-situ hash sort algorithm. All credit to William F. Gillreath and his paper 
HASH SORT: A LINEAR TIME COMPLEXITY MULITIPLE-DIMENSIONAL SORT ALGORITHM for inspiration and guidence. 
This algorithm is experimental at best and not optimized. More work will be contributed in the future.
